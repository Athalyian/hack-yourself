# Hack Yourself!
## by Areeba Khan, Victoria Nguyen, Celia Olson, Tyga P

Hack yourself is a cyber security website meant to:
* Increase awareness of how bad actors could break into accounts.
* Provide feedback on how to improve password decision making and how to avoid ones that can be easily hacked.
* Increase awareness of information provided online on social media platforms.

To get started with using this website, enter a word of choice. The website then takes that word and finds similar matches from public information like
facebook, instagram etc. It then returns information on whether you can easily be hacked or not.
